# Dorna Description

## About
This module contains all the URDF, Xacro and Meshes related to the dorna robot


**Note**: This is not the official URDF released by Dorna team, this what I created before that was released.

## Quick Start
To view the model and move the joints:
```
roslaunch dorna_description dorna_rviz.launch
```

## Important
**Warning**: DO NOT EDIT dorna.urdf

This was generated by dorna.urdf.xacro by running the command below in the desired directory:

```
rosrun xacro xacro dorna.urdf.xacro -> dorna.urdf
```

**Note**: It is important to update dorna.urdf as packages like Moveit use this file instead of dorna.urdf.xacro

## Files
* [dorna.urdf.xacro](http://git.fut.rit/robotics/code/dorna_robot/dorna_description/blob/master/urdf/dorna.urdf.xacro):
   This is the main robot description file.  It contails the joints and linkages as well as the physical properties to generate the robot description.
* [dorna.gazebo](http://git.fut.rit/robotics/code/dorna_robot/dorna_description/blob/master/urdf/dorna.gazebo):
        This file contains the gazebo pluggins as well as the display colors of the differnet links within the robot description.  This file is loaded in dorna.urdf.xacro.

* [materials.xacro](http://git.fut.rit/robotics/code/dorna_robot/dorna_description/blob/master/urdf/materials.xacro):
    This file contains different colors to display for the robot in the rviz simulation.

* [dorna.urdf](http://git.fut.rit/robotics/code/dorna_robot/dorna_description/blob/master/urdf/dorna.urdf):
    This file is automatically generated when running the spawn_model node or can be generated by running the command shown above.  This can be helpful for debugging, but should not be editted directly.
